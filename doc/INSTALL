Instructions for compiling and installing WollMux

== Prerequisites ==
=== Required software ===
The following software needs to be installed in order to build WollMux.

- Apache Ant version 1.6.2 or greater (http://ant.apache.org/)
- Java SDK 1.5 or later (http://java.sun.com/)
- OpenOffice.org 2.0 or later
- OpenOffice.org SDK 2.0 or later
- (optional, for building Debian package) dpkg-dev, fakeroot
- (optional, for working with development snapshot) git

=== Miscellaneous issues ===
- If ant gives you the error "Unable to locate tools.jar...." you need to set 
  the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the root of a Java SDK installation, 
  rather than just a JRE.

- The binaries from the OOo SDK need to be in the PATH. You may also need to
  set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the OOo programs/ subdirectory. A quick
  test to see if your OOo SDK is properly installed is to issue the
  following command on the command line:

     idlc

  If you get the following usage message

    using: idlc [-options] <file_1> ... <file_n> | @<filename> | -stdin
    [...]

  then your OOo SDK is set up correctly.

== Getting the sources ==

You can either get a release tarball or checkout the development version
from the public git repositories.

Option 1: Release tarball

- Go to http://wollmux.projects.forge.osor.eu/ and download the source tarball
  wollmux-<version>.tar.gz

- Extract the tarball somewhere. This will create a directory
  named wollmux-<version>/

Option 2: Using development sources from git

- WollMux requires an additional project for building, so start by creating
  a top-level directory for holding all the necessary projects.

    mkdir wollmux-git

- Next, change into the new directory and check out all of the required 
  projects from their respective git repositories.

    cd wollmux-git
    git clone http://wollmux.projects.forge.osor.eu/repo/WollMux.git
    git clone http://wollmux.projects.forge.osor.eu/repo/UNOHelper.git

== Building WollMux ==

- Go to the directory wollmux-<version>/WollMux and open the file build.xml
  in an editor of your choice.
    cd WollMux
    $EDITOR build.xml

- Change the properties OOO_PROGRAM_DIR, OOOCLS and OOO_SDK to match your
  system. This is *required*. The default paths will not work for you.

- If you want to compile WollMux without building a Debian package, issue
  the command

    ant

  If ant gives you the error "Unable to locate tools.jar...." you need to set 
  the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the root of a Java SDK installation, 
  rather than just a JRE.

- If you have a Debian system and want a Debian package, simply issue the 
  command

    ant deb


== Installing WollMux ==

- On a Debian system, simply install the Debian package built in the
  previous step with dpkg -i.

  This will add a program /usr/bin/wollmuxbar which launches the
  WollMux toolbar. Note, however, that you need a working configuration (not
  described in this document) before this will work.

- For a manual installation, terminate all running OpenOffice.org processes
  (including the quickstarter), then install the OpenOffice.org extension
  with the following command:

    unopkg add --shared dist/WollMux.uno.pkg

  This will result in a system-wide installation and usually requires
  administrator privileges.
  For a user installation, launch OpenOffice.org, 
  go to the menu Tools/Extension Manager and use Add to install the
  extension.

  Next, you need to install the file WollMuxBar.jar somewhere and to
  establish a way to launch it. Depending on your system, it may already be
  possible to run it by simply double-clicking it. Otherwise the command

    java -jar <path_to>/WollMuxBar.jar

  or under Windows

    javaw.exe -jar <path_to>/WollMuxBar.jar

  will run the WollMux toolbar. The dist/ directory contains a shell script
  wollmuxbar and a batch file wollmuxbar.bat that demonstrate this.
  Note, however, that you need a working configuration 
  (not described in this document) before any of this will work.
